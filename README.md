This project was created for the [To-Do List assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it by adding mobile responsiveness.

### Tech used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript
4. ![Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)

### Objectives

1. Have projects or separate lists of tasks
2. ‘Default’ project to which all tasks are put
3. Create new projects and choose which project tasks go into
4. UI Requirements:
   - View all tasks
   - View tasks in each project
   - Edit task
   - Delete task
5. Separate application logic from DOM manipulation
6. Use Web Storage API to store data

### Scope Creep

* Added mobile responsiveness.
